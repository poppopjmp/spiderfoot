  name: Multiple sites co-hosted on same infrastructure
  description: >
    Multiple websites or domains were found sharing the same
    hosting infrastructure. Co-hosted sites increase the blast
    radius of any compromise — if one site is breached, other
    sites on the same server may also be affected.

    This is especially concerning when co-hosted sites have
    different security postures or belong to different
    organisations.
