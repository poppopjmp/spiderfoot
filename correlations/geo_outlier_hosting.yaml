  name: Infrastructure hosted in unusual country
  description: >
    Infrastructure associated with the target is hosted in a
    country that appears infrequently compared to the rest of
    the target's assets. This outlier may indicate shadow IT,
    compromised infrastructure, or third-party services
    operating from unexpected jurisdictions.

    Unusual hosting locations can also signal compliance risks
    for data sovereignty or regulatory requirements.
