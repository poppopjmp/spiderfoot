  name: DNS SRV record reveals internal services
  description: >
    DNS SRV records were found that reveal internal service
    names, ports, and protocols. SRV records are used for
    service discovery (e.g., LDAP, SIP, XMPP, Kerberos)
    and can disclose internal infrastructure topology to
    attackers performing reconnaissance.
