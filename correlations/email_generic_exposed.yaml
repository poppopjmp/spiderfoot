  name: Generic email address discovered
  description: >
    Generic or role-based email addresses (e.g., info@, admin@,
    support@) were found. While expected, these addresses are
    frequently targeted in phishing campaigns and may be shared
    among multiple staff members, increasing the risk of
    credential compromise.
