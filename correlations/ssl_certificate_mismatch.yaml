  name: SSL certificate hostname mismatch
  description: >
    An SSL/TLS certificate does not match the hostname it is
    serving. This can indicate misconfigured infrastructure,
    shared hosting without proper certificate management, or
    potentially a man-in-the-middle attack.

    Certificate mismatches also cause browser warnings which
    can train users to ignore security indicators.
