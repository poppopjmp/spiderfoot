  name: Domain WHOIS data reveals registration details
  description: >
    WHOIS data for target domains was retrieved, potentially
    revealing registrant details, registration dates, and
    nameserver configurations. This information can identify
    related domains, upcoming domain expirations, or discrepancies
    in ownership that may indicate domain hijacking risk.

    Domains nearing expiration are at risk of being registered
    by adversaries if not renewed in time.
