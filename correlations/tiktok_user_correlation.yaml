  description: >
    Correlates TikTok social media profiles with other digital
    identities discovered during the scan, such as usernames,
    email addresses, or profiles on other social platforms.

    Cross-platform identity correlation helps build a complete
    picture of a target's digital footprint and can reveal
    connections between seemingly unrelated online identities.
